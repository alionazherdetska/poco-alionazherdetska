<!-- 
The <p> element will have a blue background (rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)),
because the second rule (p.info) is more specific. It has one hit 
on the third level (class) and one on the fourth level (tag). 
In contrast, the first rule (p) has only one hit on the fourth 
level (tag), making it less specific.  -->
