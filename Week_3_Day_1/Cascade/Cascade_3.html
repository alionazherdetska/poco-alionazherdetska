<!-- The <p> element has the ID "tip" and the class "info", so it inherits styles from both 
p.info and p#tip.

  Comparing the specificity:
  
  Rule p.info has one hit on the third level (class) and one hit on the fourth level (tag).
  Rule p#tip has one hit on the second level (ID) and one hit on the fourth level (tag).
  Since p#tip has higher specificity due to the ID selector, its styles override those from p.info.
  
  So, the <p> element with the ID "tip" and the class "info" will have the following styles:
  
  Color: black (from p#tip)
  Background color: semi-transparent green (from p#tip)
  Text decoration: underline (from p.info)
  Padding: 1em (from p.info) -->
